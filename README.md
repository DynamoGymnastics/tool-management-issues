# Issue Management

### Problem
It is currently not possible with GitHub to give permissions on a repository
and allow anonymous issues to be created. We are currently in a facility where,
creating a GitHub account for each staff member to allow them to login an create
issues just isn't feasable or manageable. Creating a login, which needs to be
managed, just for this simple situation is more trouble than it's worth.


### Solution
An application can be created which will have access to the repository and allow
the creation of issues through it. A simple page with a forum, with simple fields
will allow staff members to enter the data which is relevant and send it in as an
issue. That issue will then be seen by the development staff and dealt with
accordingly.
